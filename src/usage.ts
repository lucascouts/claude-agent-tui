// best-effort per §1; it maps the JSONL message-event `usage.{input,output}_tokens` into the
// SDK's { sessionUpdate:"usage_update", size, used } shape. Story 042 FLIPPED the default to ON
// (story 039 confirmed the user's Zed ACCEPTS+RENDERS it by code); only the explicit opt-out
// USAGE_UPDATE=0/false disables it (see usage-env.ts). A rejected emission is still suppressed by
// the pump's per-session reject latch (Task 5.1, R8).
//
// Kept a self-contained module (cf. diff-source.ts) imported by the acp-agent pump; it does
// NOT go through lib.ts (the frozen upstream export surface).

// ─── Task 3.1 (R5.1, R5.3) — per-model token usage, and what this port does NOT deliver ──────────
//
// WHAT IT DELIVERS. Upstream #1037 reports token usage PER MODEL. The dimension the mapping above
// lacks is the model, and the JSONL already carries it: story 066's probe established that a model
// switch surfaces as a per-turn `assistant.message.model` tag, on the very carrier `toUsageUpdate`
// already reads. Grouping by that tag needs no new source (REBASE-AND-DRIFT.md §15.6).
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT DELIVER. Stated here on purpose: the difference between a port and a claim of
// parity is whether the code admits its own gap.
//
//   • NO CURRENT CLIENT RENDERS IT. Zed's `update_token_usage` is called only from `crates/agent/`
//     — its NATIVE agent. Nothing in `crates/agent_servers/`, the path an ACP agent such as this one
//     reaches Zed through, feeds it. The totals below are correct and have nowhere to arrive. That
//     is the inverse of a CUT seam: reachable here, inert at the far end.
//   • NOTHING HERE PUBLISHES OR BUMPS THE PACKAGE. This project is closed as a product
//     (PROJECT-CLOSURE.md); adding this function releases no npm version and bumps none, so it
//     cannot reach a client even if one later learned to render it.
//   • NO WIRE SURFACE. `usageByModel` is deliberately NOT wired into the acp-agent pump and adds no
//     field to the pinned `{ sessionUpdate, size, used }` shape. Inventing an unspecified field on
//     an UNSTABLE notification is precisely the §1 "never fabricate" failure. It is a library
//     function with tests and, by design, no caller.
//
// The ledger's word for this state is KNOWINGLY UNCONSUMED — ported because the data is present and
// the grouping is verifiable, recorded as unconsumed because no reader exists. Do not read its
// presence as parity.

 *
 * `null` rather than a string sentinel, and that is a correctness choice, not a style one. R5.1
 * names only `assistant.message.model`, so the untagged bucket is a key this port INVENTS — and any
 * string it invented could collide with a real model id. A turn tagged `"unknown"` is a model named
 * "unknown"; a turn with no tag is a different thing entirely, and folding the two together would
 * report two unrelated things as one row. `null` cannot collide, because no model id is `null`.
