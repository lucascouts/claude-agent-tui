// Story 021 / Tasks 1.1 + 2.1–2.3 — classify a `user` event's `toolUseResult` as a diff source and
// assemble the SOURCE SHAPE consumed by the reused diff translator (doc §12, §7, design D1/D3).
//
// WHAT THIS IS: a standalone, pure-logic building block that inspects a `user` event's
// `toolUseResult` and (1.1) classifies WHETHER it can serve as a diff source, then (2.1) into WHICH
// diff shape — Edit (`type:update`) or Write (`type:create`) — and (2.2/2.3) builds the
// `{filePath, structuredPatch}` input that the REUSED `toolUpdateFromDiffToolResponse` (tools.ts)
// renders into ACP diff content. This module assembles the input only; it never renders the diff
// itself and never modifies tools.ts.
//
// WHY (design D1, R1.1/R1.2): a `file-history-snapshot` carries ONLY {backupFileName, version,
// backupTime} — no inline file content — and ≈55% have `backupFileName:null` (a new file). It
// references a backup but never the bytes, so it can never reconstruct a diff. It is therefore
// excluded as a diff source here, AND excluded one layer up at the §6 type-routing seam
// (`classifyEvent` → lifecycle). The real diff source is the `user` event's `toolUseResult`:
// `structuredPatch` + `originalFile` for an Edit; `content` (with an EMPTY structuredPatch) for a Write.
//
// DECISION A (reuse-faithful, approved at run start — see `.draft/deviations.yaml` tasks 2.2/2.3):
//   - Edit: the hunks pass through VERBATIM. The reused translator derives oldText/newText from each
//     hunk's `lines` (`-`/context → old, `+`/context → new) and IGNORES `originalFile`, so a diff's
//     oldText is the HUNK-DERIVED pre-edit text (the SDK-identical shape), NOT the whole `originalFile`.
//   - Write: an empty structuredPatch has nothing for the reused translator to read, so the Write is
//     normalised into ONE synthetic all-additions hunk (every `content` line prefixed `+`). With no
//     `-`/context lines the reused translator yields `oldText:null` (literal null, D3) and
//     newText=`content`, rendering the whole new file as added — reusing the SAME function for Write.
//
// POSTURE: READ-ONLY (the module only INSPECTS the payload, never mutates it), dependency-free
// (no `node:` builtins needed), and adds NO custom JSONL parser and NO patch-apply parser. It is
// deliberately self-contained and NOT exported from lib.ts (whose surface is frozen to upstream
// v0.53.0 and locked by test/lib-exports.test.ts) — its unit tests import it directly from
// dist/diff-source.js (and the reused translator from dist/tools.js).
//
// TOLERANCE (skip-and-log, §6): an unknown or odd shape must NEVER throw and must NEVER be emitted as
// a half-built edit/write with an undefined field. A diff-bearing payload whose shape cannot be
// verified — an Edit missing `originalFile`, a Write (empty structuredPatch) missing `content` — is
// logged to STDERR and degraded to `unsupported`; a payload with none of the diff fields stays
// `not-a-diff-source` (Task 1.1, never regressed).
//
// TASK 3.1 (render seam, R4.1/R4.2): `diffToolCallUpdate(source, toolCallId)` renders a classified
// source through the REUSED, unmodified `toolUpdateFromDiffToolResponse` (tools.ts §3) — the ONLY
// place this module calls the reused translator — and wraps the rendered hunks in the §7
// `tool_call_update` envelope attached to the OPEN `toolCallId` (story 019 seam; it does not open a
// new tool call). Reuse-faithful (Decision A): the reused translator dictates oldText/newText, and the
// only normalisation (Write's synthetic hunk) lives in {@link toDiffToolResponse}, never in tools.ts.
//
// TASK 3.2 (cover-or-log MultiEdit/NotebookEdit/MCP, R5.1/R5.2; design D4): only Edit and Write are
// verified upstream. A payload whose `toolUseResult` already has the RECOGNISED Edit shape (non-empty
// structuredPatch + string originalFile) maps to `edit` regardless of tool name (the shape-first
// branch below already does this — MultiEdit included). A diff-bearing tool name whose shape is NOT
// mappable is detected, skip-and-logged for drift telemetry, and degraded to `unsupported` (NOT
// `not-a-diff-source`) — never thrown, never aborting the turn. Diff-bearing names are the set
// {Edit, Write, MultiEdit, NotebookEdit} plus any name starting with `mcp__`; a contentless payload
// with NO diff-bearing name (e.g. a `file-history-snapshot`, name `undefined`) stays the silent
// `not-a-diff-source` (Task 1.1, never regressed).
//
// TASK 4.1 (post-hoc render-only caveat + optional file-history index, R6.1/R6.2): the JSONL records
// the patch AFTER the edit is already applied, so every diff rendered through this module is POST-HOC
// and RENDER-ONLY — it shows what changed but is NOT a pre-apply accept/reject gate. That gate is
// `openDiff` (doc §9), which is OUT OF SCOPE here and, per the Degrau-0 read-only posture
// (experiments/DEGRAU0-RESULTS.md decision 4), is not shipped in Degrau-1 at all: ACP-side input is
// disabled, prompts arrive only via the mirrored TUI, and Zed renders tool calls/diffs post-hoc. The
// `~/.claude/file-history/<uuid>/<hash>@vN` tree is recorded as an OPTIONAL old-version index ONLY;
// its `<uuid>`↔session key is unknown and it is to be investigated ONLY if an old-version lookup is
// ever needed — this module neither builds nor queries it.
