// === §2 MOTOR box — node-pty spawn of the real interactive `claude` TUI (story 013) ===
//
// Spawns the user's *subscription* `claude` TUI under a REAL pseudo-terminal with a
// sanitized, subscription-billing environment, so the JSONL transcript self-labels its
// message events with entrypoint='cli' (subscription) rather than an SDK/credit signal.
// Degrau 0 proved the premise empirically: a clean-env PTY run yields the distinct
// entrypoint set {cli}; the negative control (inherited SDK env) flips it to {sdk-ts}
// (experiments/DEGRAU0-RESULTS.md, E1 = PASS — the keystone gate).
//
// Spec is PINNED by IMPLEMENTACAO-FORK-ACP.md §5 (Spawn — mantém assinatura) and §10
// (billing audit). This module imports NO SDK — no credit-billing `query()` path is
// reachable through it (the engine seam stays read-only in Degrau 1).
//
// Scope: this module owns ONLY the spawn moment (argv, sanitized env, taint guard,
// launch). Process lifecycle/resume is story 014; the JSONL tail watcher is story 015;
// the ACP createSession rewrite that wires this engine in is story 023.

// Multi-line text MUST use bracketed-paste (the branch in sendPrompt below).
// All writes go directly through `p.write` — no xterm.js interposed.
//
// --- Empirical validation (task 4.2 / R3.3 / R5.3 — live run 2026-06-09, claude 2.1.170) ---
// The previously-UNTESTED bracketed-paste multi-line path is CONFIRMED: a 3-line and a
// 5-line prompt each submitted as EXACTLY ONE `user` event over the wire (R2.3 / R5.2) —
// the TUI treats the `\x1b[200~…\x1b[201~` envelope as a single paste, not one turn per
// embedded newline. The ~60 ms write→`\r` delay commits both single-line and multi-line
// submissions; on long input the `\r` is NOT absorbed into the paste body (R3.2).
//
// Flakiness observed (R3.3): single-line submission is reliable in isolation (3/3 live
// runs), but one transient MISS occurred when the engine was spawned back-to-back with
// other live engines in the same batch — that run created NO transcript at all (the
// submission never committed: no first interaction → no JSONL, per story 028). The miss
// correlates with TUI input-readiness right after a rapid re-spawn, NOT with the 60 ms
// constant (raising the delay would not help a not-yet-ready TUI). The bracketed-paste
// envelope proved the more robust path (atomic paste finalization). Resolving guidance:
// let the TUI reach input-readiness (the BOOT settle) before the first submission; the
// 60 ms submit delay itself needs no change.
//
// Shift+Tab plan-mode entry (`\x1b[Z`) remains the UNTESTED, unwired fallback — see
// buildClaudeCmd above; `--permission-mode plan` is the wired deterministic path (R4).
