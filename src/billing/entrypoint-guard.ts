// Story 022 — entrypoint billing guard-rail.
//
// ── GOOD-FAITH LIMITS (this guard-rail is a SIGNAL, never a lever) ─────────────────────────────────
// Sources: doc §10 "Auditoria de billing — entrypoint"; §0 TL;DR point 3; Appendix row
// "`entrypoint` como prova de billing"; experiments/DEGRAU0-RESULTS.md (E1).
//
//   (a) `entrypoint` is a CLIENT SELF-LABEL, written verbatim from an env var without checking the
//       real mode. It is a GOOD-FAITH SIGNAL — NOT contractual proof that the run billed on the Claude
//       subscription, and NOT a contract published by Anthropic. Billing is decided server-side by the
//       headers the client sends; we do not capture TLS, so this field corroborates, it does not prove.
//   (b) This code NEVER forces or spoofs `entrypoint=cli`. It only READS and REACTS — rewriting the
//       value toward 'cli' would be spoofing-with-enforcement (the OpenClaw case) = evasion. `guardEvent`
//       leaves the observed value untouched and aborts on a credit-class label instead.
//   (c) The subscription GUARANTEE comes from RUNNING THE REAL TUI with a sanitized env — the E1
//       keystone (experiments/DEGRAU0-RESULTS.md: a clean-env PTY writes `entrypoint=='cli'`
//       ORGANICALLY), with billing decided server-side. This guard-rail only DETECTS a drift into
//       credit (sdk-*/print) after the fact; it must never manufacture the subscription posture.
// ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Story 022 / Task 1.1 — subscription/credit taxonomy + classifier for the runtime
// entrypoint billing guard-rail (doc §10 "Auditoria de billing — entrypoint").
//
// WHAT THIS IS: the centralized §10 taxonomy (two frozen label sets) plus `classifyEntrypoint`,
// a PURE function mapping a client-emitted `entrypoint` self-label to a billing class:
//   - SUBSCRIPTION (OK): the TUI / first-party clients that bill on the Claude subscription.
//   - CREDIT (ABORT): the Agent SDK / headless `-p` clients that bill on API credit.
//   - 'unknown': any label in NEITHER set. It MUST be treated conservatively by the caller
//     (task 2.2) and MUST NEVER fall through to 'subscription' — an unrecognized or newly
//     introduced label is not proof of subscription billing.
//
// WHY a centralized, version-noted constant (doc §10): the taxonomy was reverse-engineered from
// the `claude` binary 2.1.159 and the `entrypoint` field is the client's own self-label (written
// verbatim from an env var, not a published contract). It may drift between 2.1.x versions, so the
// sets live in ONE place with the source version cited below — a binary bump shows up in review.
//
// SOURCE: doc §10 "Auditoria de billing — entrypoint", reverse-engineered from `claude` binary
// 2.1.159. If the binary version changes, re-audit these two sets against the new binary.

// Task 3.1 — startup self-check: fail fast on leaked SDK env BEFORE spawn.

// `assertCleanBillingEnv` is the POST-CONDITION assertion for the spawn helper's env-sanitize

// delete-and-continue — deletion is the helper's job; this is the read-only check that it worked.
// Inheriting any of these keys from the parent Node/ACP process would silently bill the spawned
// TUI as API credit (R1, §10) BEFORE any message event is produced, so this must run BEFORE spawn.

// `CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT` plus the whole `CLAUDE_AGENT_SDK_*` family. The family is matched by
// PREFIX (not an enumerated list) on purpose: it covers today's `CLAUDE_AGENT_SDK_VERSION` /
// `CLAUDE_AGENT_SDK_CLIENT_APP` AND catches any future `CLAUDE_AGENT_SDK_*` sibling the helper's
// fixed deletion list might miss.
//
// `CLAUDECODE` is deliberately NOT checked here. It IS one of engine-pty's FORBIDDEN_BILLING_VARS,
// but it is the spawn helper's ANTI-RECUSA (anti-nesting) concern — it makes the nested `claude` TUI
// refuse to start — which is distinct from this BILLING check (§10). Folding it in here would
// conflate the two guard-rails, so it stays out of the collection logic.
