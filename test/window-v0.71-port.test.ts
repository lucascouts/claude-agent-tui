// Story 009 / Task 8.2 — the reachable half of the `v0.71.0` → `v0.75.1` window (R5.2, R7.3, R7.4).
//
// CONTRACT. §16 of docs/REBASE-AND-DRIFT.md classified 13 upstream commits and found three
// portable FRAGMENTS, no whole commits. This file pins one behaviour per ported fragment, plus
// the catalogue entry R5.2 asks for.
//
//   R5.2  Fable 5.1 joins the curated catalogue, under the alias the CLI ACCEPTS and declaring its
//         effort capability like every other Claude-5-family surface. The alias was originally
//         taken from `strings /opt/bin/claude` (`fable51`), and that was WRONG: the binary carries
//         that token as an internal id→short-name mapping, not as a `--model` value. The CLI's
//         alias vocabulary is a closed set that holds only tier names, so `fable51` 404'd at spawn
//         with `[claude-code:unrecognized_model]`. Corrected 2026-09-23 to the probed `fable`.
//   R7.3  `#1079` and `#1080` are PORTABLE IN PART, so the reachable part lands AND the code
//         records which half was cut.
//   R7.4  A port that would deliver upstream's degraded path, or produce data no client renders,
//         says so at the call site instead of presenting itself as parity. `CUT_FROM_UPSTREAM`
//         is that statement, made machine-checkable rather than left in prose.
//
// What is NOT here, deliberately: `#991`'s outcome. §16.7 made it conditional on a client asking
// for a compaction event, and none does — this engine already keeps continuity across the
// boundary through the JSONL `summary` row (linearize.ts:106-109).
//
// node:test runner (build first):
//   npm run build && node --experimental-strip-types --test test/window-v0.71-port.test.ts
