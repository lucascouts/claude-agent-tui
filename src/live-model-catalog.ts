/**
 * The model picker, read from the CLI at runtime instead of curated by hand.
 *
 * WHY THIS REPLACED A STATIC LIST. `model-catalog.ts` was written when the CLI
 * appeared to expose no way to enumerate models, and that premise was wrong: the
 * SDK's `query().supportedModels()` is exactly such an endpoint, and this package
 * already depends on the SDK. The hand-curated list cost two silent bugs in one
 * month — `fable51`/`fable5`, aliases the CLI rejects outright, and an `Opus 4.8`
 * label on rows that had been serving Opus 5.5 for weeks. Neither failed a test,
 * because there was nothing to compare the list against.
 *
 * WHAT MADE IT UNFIXABLE BY HAND. The catalogue is served by the BACKEND, not
 * baked into the installed CLI. Measured 2026-09-23, it alternated between two
 * shapes within minutes under a fixed binary — five rows with `[1m]`-suffixed
 * values and bare family titles ("Fable", "Opus (1M context)"), and eleven rows
 * with version-bearing titles ("Fable 5.1", "Opus 5.5") and different taglines
 * entirely. No snapshot of either is right for long, so the only list that stays
 * correct is the one fetched.
 *
 * **It must be the PATH `claude`, never the SDK's embedded binary.** That is the
 * keystone this whole fork rests on: the PATH binary bills as subscription
 * (`entrypoint == 'cli'`), the SDK-embedded one bills as credit — see
 * `claude-path.ts`. Pointing the fetch at the embedded binary would also read a
 * DIFFERENT catalogue from the one the PTY actually runs, which is the exact
 * divergence this module exists to close. Both reasons point the same way.
 *
 * FAIL-SOFT, ALWAYS. Every failure path — no CLI on PATH, a spawn error, a
 * control-request timeout, an empty answer — falls back to {@link MODEL_CATALOG}.
 * The static list is therefore no longer the source of truth, but it is still the
 * floor: a picker with stale rows beats a session that cannot start.

 * today. Upstream `claude-agent-acp` and `claude-agent-plus` both replace it with
