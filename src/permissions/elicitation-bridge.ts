// Story 065 / Task 2.2 — the pure elicitation bridge: project an AskUserQuestion tool_input into an
// ACP `session/request_elicitation` (form) request, map the user's outcome back to a gate `deny`+reason
// decision, and perform the bounded, fail-closed round-trip against an injectable client (R1.1, R1.2,
// R2, R4).
//
// FLOW: claude's `AskUserQuestion` tool cannot be satisfied by a PreToolUse hook (a hook can only
// allow/deny — it cannot synthesize a native tool_result). So the gate ALWAYS denies AskUserQuestion at
// the wire (R2.1 seam) and instead raises a real ACP form elicitation in Zed; whatever the user picks
// travels back to the model INSIDE the deny `reason` string (mirrors hook-server's DenyWithReason).
//
// FAIL CLOSED (the load-bearing safety posture — design.md "Fail closed everywhere"):
//   - a timeout waiting on the client → cancel (a dismissal, NEVER an accept);
//   - an ACP transport error (client throws) → cancel;
//   - a malformed response (action not one of accept|decline|cancel) → cancel;
//   - a cancel/decline (or any unrecognized action) maps to a `deny` whose reason reads as a user
//     dismissal, not an answer.
//
// This module owns NO server and NO PTY; it is a pure projection + ACP-bridge unit driven by an
// injectable client surface so a unit test runs it OFFLINE against a fake client. It imports NOTHING
// internal, and only `import type` from the SDK — the runtime zod validators are NOT importable here
// (the package `exports` map blocks the deep specifier), so every guard below is STRUCTURAL.
